abstract: |
    Data providers and curators provide a great deal of metadata with their data
    files: this metadata is invaluable for users and for Virtual Observatory
    software developers. In order to be interoperable, the metadata must refer
    to common Data Models. This specification defines a scheme for annotating
    VOTable instances in a standard, consistent, interoperable fashion, so that
    each piece of metadata can unambiguously refer to the correct Data Model
    element it expresses, assuming there is a suitable data model.
    With this specification, data providers can
    unambiguously and completely represent Data Model instances in the VOTable
    format, and clients can build *faithful* representations of such instances.
    The mapping is operated through opaque, portable strings. These used to be
    called `utypes`, but document uses a new annotation mechanism. This proposal
    assumes agreement on a VOTable extension that adds an explicit mapping
    element `<VODML>` to selected VOTable elements (`GROUP`, `PARAM`, `PARAMref`,
    `FIELDref`) and which indicates that those elements are representing
    particular elements from some VO-DML model.
